## Four models

There are four models of Open Access publishing, roughly forming a rough hierarchy from worst to best:
- Green Open Access
- Hybrid Open Access
- Gold Open Access
- Diamond Open Access

### Green Open Access

Green Open Access means that the author is responsible for ensuring open access
to the publication.
This usually means that the author and the journal have to agree that the author
has the right to do this, which often comes with some restrictions, for example an
embargo period.^[Many funders no longer permit these embargo periods in their Open Access requirements.]
Some mechanisms for ensuring open access achieve Green Open Access by rights retention
mechanisms -- the authors deliberately reserve rights when dealing with journals,
or the university, funder, etc. establishes a prior claim to the work that prevents
authors signing the rights away for publication.

Green Open Access entails finding a place to store the publication
(and publicising its existence!) -- something the journal usually does for you.
This can mean using a repository service, perhaps a preprinting service or a
university research archive, or it can mean publishing on your personal website.
Often, journals will claim the rights to the final typeset version of a manuscript
and will only allow an unformatted version to be shared using Green Open Access.

### Hybrid Open Access

Hybrid Open Access is Gold Open Access (see below) in journals that _also_ publish
normal, non-open access content.
Universities sometimes offer read-and-publish arrangements with Hybrid journals
that allow their researchers to read non-Open Access content and to publish
Open Access articles with the journal.

### Gold Open Access

Gold Open Access means that the journal makes the final version of the article
available immediately, for free, to anyone, under a
[CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.
The journal will charge you, the author, for this service.
This fee is known as an 'article processing charge' or APC.
These fees are usually in the region of Â£2000 per article.

Many funders, including UKRI funders,
the British Heart Foundation and Cancer Research UK, and Wellcome,
require Gold Open Access.
Many funders that require Gold Open Access will _not_ allow publication in
Hybrid Open Access journals.

### Diamond Open Access

Diamond Open Access is Gold Open Access without charging the authors an APC.
This model is usually supported by a consortium or institution and is worth
supporting where it is possible to do so.
