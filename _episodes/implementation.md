## Finding journals `30 min`

Most researchers have a hierarchy of journals they target for publishing.
Take 30 minutes to go through your list and identify their open access policy.
Draw up a table that looks like this:

| Rank | Journal name | Journal OA Policy notes                                                        |
|-----:|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    1 |              |                                                                                |
|    2 |              |                                                                                |
|    3 |              |                                                                                |
|    4 |              |                                                                                |
|    5 |              |                                                                                |
