## What is Open Access
Open Access means that readers have free, unrestricted access to published research outputs.

## Why choose Open Access?

> ## Enumerating the benefits `5 min`
> In small groups, try to think of reasons people publish academic work.
> In what ways might open access help achieve these goals?
> Using the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>,
> jot down any ideas you come up with, so that we have an overall list at the end.
> > ## Ideas
> > Some reasons that are commonly cited are:
> > - We publish because we want people to know what we've done
> > - We want people to be able to build on our work
> > - We want to get credit for our work
> > - Open Access publishing is a requirement for advancing our careers
> > - Open Access is required by our university, funder, etc.
> > - We want people outside academia to access our work (policy makers, charities, industry, etc.)
> {: .solution}
{: .prereq}

> ## Considering the concerns `5 min`
> In the same groups, try to think of reasons people might hesitate to publish their work openly.
> Again, use the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>
> to jot down any ideas you come up with.
> > ## Ideas
> > Some reasons that are commonly cited are:
> > - People might find mistakes in my work
> > - People might misunderstand my work
> > - It takes time to write papers in a way that is suitable for people outside my field to understand
> > - Publishing open access is too expensive
> > - People could use my work for purposes I don't agree with
> > - I worked hard to collect these data and I don't want non-academics to benefit from my work
> > - I want to start a business based on my work and I want to keep an advantage over other companies
> {: .solution}
{: .prereq}

> ## Your experiences `10 min`
> Now we have listed some benefits and concerns of open access publishing,
> go around your small group and have
> each group member identify two items that they have experience with.
> You can choose a benefit and a concern, or two benefits or even two concerns.
> For each one, share your experience of it with your colleagues.
> If you have time, add a brief note about your experience to the
> <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>,
> but the focus should be on sharing with your colleagues and listening to what they have to say.
{: .challenge}

> ## Addressing concerns `10 min`
> We have a list of concerns that people in your workshops might have.
> It's helpful to be able to provide some perspective on those concerns --
> we want to acknowledge that publishing openly can be frightening or difficult,
> but highlight that it is worth doing anyway!
>
> Again, in your group, choose two of the concerns. If they are concerns you have
> or have had yourself, that's ideal, but they could also be ones that you just
> find interesting.
> Go around the group, discussing each person's concerns.
> Try to think of reasons why the concern should not hold you back from
> open access publishing.
> If you can't think of anything, try asking the larger group or one of the
> workshop instructors or helpers.
>
> Remember, it's not wrong to have concerns! We believe that open access publishing
> is important and that the benefits outweigh the concerns, and we'd like to help
> you understand why and give you any encouragement you need.
